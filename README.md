# Guinea Pig - An Exercise to Test Javascript Event Handlers

### Instructions
The instructions on this were pretty simple and are as follows:

  1. When any section is clicked the output target text should be "You clicked on the {text of the section} section"
  2. When the mouse is over the h1 tag, the output element should contain the text "You moved your mouse over the header".
  3. When the mouse leaves the h1 tag, the output element should contain the text "You left me!!".
  4. When you type characters into the input field, the output element should mirror the text in the input field.
  5. When you click the "Add color" button, the guinea-pig element's text color should change to blue.
  6. When you click the "Hulkify" button, the guinea-pig element's font size should become much larger.
  7. When you click the "Capture it" button, the guinea-pig element should have a border added to it.
  8. When you click the "Rounded" button, the guinea-pig element's border should become rounded.
  9. The first section's text should be bold.
  10. The last section's text should be bold and italicized.
  11. Make the buttons stop appearing next to each other as inline elements. Change them into block elements.


###Completion Notes:
The first eight of these were accomplished with pure Javascript. The final three were done with an external CSS file. The hardest part of this was getting the text in the output field to mirror the text in the input field. That took some google fu to accomplish, but ended up being a relatively simple fix.
